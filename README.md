Objective of this document is to share practical knowledge related to Kubernetes features like Pods, ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, Deployments etc.
To experiment these things, I setup minikube on my local laptop so that I can simulate and run the actual commands on my local machine.

As a pre-requisite I expect the audience should be aware of following things:
	1. Containerization and Orchestration Concepts
	2. Knowledge of Docker, Images, Containers etc. is must
	3. A basic understanding of YAML

Now assuming that you have all these things and 8-GB RAM on your machine. For my own learning, I setup the environment on my Windows 10 64-bit OS laptop.

Let's start and Happy Learning :) !!
